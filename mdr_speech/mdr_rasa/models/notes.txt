Python dependencies:
sudo pip2 install sklearn_crfsuite spacy sklearn

Afterwards run:
sudo python -m spacy download en

Further dependencies may be needed:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RasaHQ/starter-pack-rasa-nlu/master/requirements.txt
sudo pip2 install -r requirements.txt

If you have a really old laptop (like I do) you might need to uninstall tensorflow.
It crashes rasa if required CPU instruction sets are missing and isn't needed
for training with spacy anyway.
